🥔 Potato Disease Classifier

This project is a machine learning–based image classification system designed to detect diseases in potato leaves using images. It helps in early identification of plant diseases, supporting farmers and researchers in taking timely action.

📌 Project Overview

The model classifies potato leaf images into three categories:

Healthy

Early Blight

Late Blight

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to learn visual patterns such as spots, discoloration, and texture variations present in diseased leaves.

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled potato leaf images divided into three classes:

Healthy potato leaves

Potato leaves affected by Early Blight

Potato leaves affected by Late Blight

The images are preprocessed by resizing and normalization before training. The dataset is split into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

OpenCV / PIL

✅ Outcome

The trained model predicts the disease category of a given potato leaf image based on learned features.
